    "# CHSH Game: Testing the Limits of Reality with Quantum Mechanics \n",
    "Would you like to re-create some of the experiments that led to the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics? And how about proving Einstein wrong while we’re at it? If that sounds fun, keep reading - this notebook explores the CHSH game, a thought experiment and quantum circuit that demonstrates how quantum entanglement can lead to results that defy classical intuition."

    "Quantum particles exhibit some very weird (to us humans) phenomenon. Chief among the freaky properties of quantum particles are superposition and entanglement. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superposition is the property of quantum bits (qubits) that allows them to exist in a linear combination of multiple states simultaneously - until they are observed. \n",
    "- Entanglement is the phenomenon where the quantum state of each particle in a group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are the key reason why quantum computing works and is better at certain tasks than classical computing. However, quantum theory when first proposed did not find support from some key scientists - Albert Einstein the most prominent one among them. Einstein strongly believed that that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory. What appeared to us as particles behaving probabilistically was in fact just proof that the theory was incomplete and that other hidden variables were at play which we were ignorant about."

    "In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) published a thought-provoking paper questioning the completeness of quantum mechanics. The EPR paradox highlighted the contradiction between quantum mechanics' probabilistic predictions and the principle of locality - the idea that objects are only influenced by their immediate surroundings. The authors of the EPR paper argued that entanglement would imply that any measurement on the first entangled particle would instantaneously affect the second, no matter how far apart they are. This would be impossible according to the theory of relativity, which forbids faster than light communication. Thus, EPR introduced the concept of \"hidden variables,\" hypothesizing that quantum mechanics might be an incomplete description of reality and that there were other factors that deterministically define the measurement outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was the basis of Einstein's famous remark, “God does not play dice”. In response, Niels Bohr is said to have replied, \"Stop telling God what to do with his dice.\" Bohr defended the Copenhagen interpretation, arguing that quantum mechanics provides a complete description of nature but requires abandoning classical notions of determinism and locality. This philosophical clash between Bohr and Einstein set the stage for one of the most profound debates in physics."

If your classical win rate is slightly higher or lower - this is due to randomness.For example, even though a fair coin has a 50% chance of landing heads, tossing it just 10 times may yield 7 heads or only 3. This is why we simulate the game over 1,000 trials — the more repetitions, the closer the empirical win rate approaches the theoretical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we run the quantum strategy, something remarkable happens: the win rate jumps to approximately 85%. This isn't a fluke — it reflects a deep feature of quantum mechanics. Alice and Bob share a pair of entangled qubits, and by carefully choosing their measurement angles based on their respective input bits, they exploit quantum correlations that have no classical explanation. Their measurement outcomes are not just random — they’re quantum-coordinated in a way that increases their chances of meeting the CHSH win condition. This optimal quantum strategy reaches the so-called Tsirelson bound, which sets the maximum possible win rate in the CHSH game allowed by quantum physics:"

    "This bound is not just higher than the classical limit — it's fundamentally unreachable by any classical means. No hidden-variable theory or pre-agreed strategy can surpass the 75% threshold. Only entanglement enables such performance. \n",

    "Until now, we’ve used the Aer simulator to model a quantum computer, with all computations running locally on our own CPU. But thanks to modern cloud-based platforms, we can now go a step further. From the comfort of our homes, we have access to real quantum hardware provided by IBM. Let’s now run the same CHSH experiment on an actual IBM quantum computer and see how it performs in the real world.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The CHSH game isn't just a theoretical exercise - it's a real, testable way to distinguish between classical and quantum worlds. The fact that our quantum strategy reliably beats the classical 75% limit offers experimental validation of quantum mechanics. This disproves Einstein’s local hidden variable theories and is one of the clearest demonstrations that the universe behaves in a genuinely non-classical, nonlocal way. And now, you have also re-created the experiments which proved Einstein wrong and led to a Nobel prize, all from the comfort of your own home!\n",
