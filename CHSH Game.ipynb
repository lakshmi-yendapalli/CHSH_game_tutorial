    "### Einstein Bohr debates\n",
    "Quantum particles exhibit some very weird (to us humans) phenomenon. Chief among the freaky properties of quantum particles are superposition and entanglement. These properties are the key reason why Quantum Computing works and is better at certain tasks than classical computing. However, quantum theory when first proposed did not find support from some key scientists – Albert Einstein the most prominent one among them. Einstein strongly believed that that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory. What appeared to us as particles behaving probabilistically was in fact just proof that the theory was incomplete and that other hidden variables were at play which we were ignorant about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) published a thought-provoking paper questioning the completeness of quantum mechanics. The EPR paradox was rooted in the apparent contradiction between quantum mechanics' probabilistic predictions and the principle of locality — the idea that objects are only influenced by their immediate surroundings. EPR introduced the concept of \"hidden variables,\" hypothesizing that quantum mechanics might be an incomplete description of reality."

Bohr defended the Copenhagen interpretation, arguing that quantum mechanics provides a complete description of nature but requires abandoning classical notions of determinism and locality. This philosophical clash between Bohr and Einstein set the stage for one of the most profound debates in physics."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The CHSH game isn't just a theoretical exercise — it's a real, testable way to distinguish between classical and quantum worlds. The fact that our quantum strategy reliably beats the classical 75% limit offers experimental validation of quantum mechanics. This disproves Einstein’s local hidden variable theories and is one of the clearest demonstrations that the universe behaves in a genuinely non-classical, nonlocal way. And now, you have also re-created the experiments which proved Einstein wrong and led to a Nobel prize, all from the comfort of your own home!\n",
